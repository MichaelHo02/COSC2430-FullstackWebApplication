        <p class="article__paragraph">
          InstaKilogram is a web service similar to Instagram. To test our
          market, we are developing the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).Think of it
          as a new way to share life's moments and memories with family and
          friends.We all have these little things in our lives that we want to
          capture and store for ourselves - from breakfast in that perfect cafe,
          the tree at Christmas, or your baby's first steps. InstaKilogram will
          allow you to upload a photo or video and attach some text for your
          loved ones on any device and any time.It all started when I wanted to
          send my sister an album of my life as I see it, but didn't know how.
          So we've created InstaKilogram!
